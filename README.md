# Svelte Landing Page
This project contains a basic landing page built in Svelte, inspired by the [video by Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSTQzlprGLI&t=1823s). It is primarily built for personal use and as a "method" to gain experience and fluency in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev).

## Features
### Front screen
The landing page contains a front page containing a timer, a greeting that changes depending on the time of the day, and a search bar that will refer you to [Ecosia](https://ecosia.org).

### Tools page
The second page might be one that will be more useful for other people when customized, as it contains a tile grid with (for me personally) useful links, with a smoothly looking background. These links are actually fully customizable when forking the repository by changing the object in the "Tools.svelte" file.
